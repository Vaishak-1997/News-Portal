    <h1 style="text-transform: uppercase;" align="center">Rep. James Comer says two county attorneys have asked him how they can 'go after the Bidens'</h1>
    <h3 align="center">Comer's comments come after Trump was indicted on charges of falsifying business records</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 21px;" color="black">Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said that two county attorneys from Tennessee and Kentucky have asked him how they can "go after" the Biden's following Former President Trump's indictment. 
        Comer made the comments on Wednesday on Fox & Friends.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 21px;" color="black">"And I’ll tell you, one of the things that I don’t think it’s been picked up a lot that’s going to be a problem. And I had two calls yesterday, one from a county attorney in Kentucky and one from a county attorney in Tennessee. They were Republican, obviously, both states are heavily Republican. They want to know if there are ways they can go after the Biden's now," Comer said. 
        He added that the Democrats have "opened a can of worms."</p>

    <p style="font-size: 21px;" color="black">"They’ve set precedents now that we can’t go back on. And now we’re going to see a judicial system that’s already bogged down with doing what they’re supposed to do, and that’s going after real criminals, people that are committing real crimes, burglaries, rape, robberies, things like that. And now you’re going to start having ambitious political people like Alvin Bragg try to make a name for themselves and go after big pie-in-the-sky federal cases. And it’s just not a good path that we need to go forward on in our judiciary," Comer said.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 21px;" color="black">Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree on Tuesday.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 21px;" color="black">The falsifying records charge is typically considered a misdemeanor, but rises to a felony when a defendant's "intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof."</p>

    <p style="font-size: 21px;" color="black">During a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was asked why the second alleged concealed crime wasn't specified in the indictment.</p>
