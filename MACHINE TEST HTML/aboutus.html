    <h1 align="center">ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>The Fox News Channel, abbreviated FNC, commonly known as Fox News, is an American multinational conservative news entertainment and political commentary television channel and website based in New York City.[3][4] It is owned by Fox News Media, which itself is owned by the Fox Corporation.[5] It is the most-watched cable network in the U.S.[6][7][8] The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan. Fox News provides a service to 86 countries and territories,[9] with international broadcasts featuring Fox Extra segments during advertising breaks.[10] <br>
       The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch in 1996 to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO.[11][12] It launched on October 7, 1996, to 17 million cable subscribers.[13] Fox News grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant United States cable news subscription network.[14] By September 2018, 87 million U.S. households (91 percent of television subscribers) could receive Fox News.[15] In 2019, it was the top-rated cable network, averaging 2.5 million viewers in prime time.[16][17][18] As of April 2022, Murdoch is the executive chairman since 2016,[19][20] and Suzanne Scott has been the CEO since 2018.[21] <br>
       Fox News controversies have included biased reporting in favor of the Republican Party, its politicians, and  conservative causes,[22][23][24] while portraying the Democratic Party in a negative light.[25][26] Critics have argued that the channel is damaging to the integrity of news overall.[27][28] Fox News has denied bias in its reporting. The channel's official position is that its reporting operates independently of its opinion journalism.[29][needs update] Internal communications released in February 2023 showed several prominent network hosts and senior executives—including chairman Murdoch and CEO Scott—discussing their knowledge that 2020 presidential election fraud allegations they were reporting were false; the communications showed the network was concerned that not reporting the falsehoods would alienate viewers and cause them to switch to rival conservative networks, impacting corporate profitability.[30][31] According to Pew Research Center, in 2019, 65 percent of Republicans and people who lean Republican trusted Fox News.[32]</p>

    <hr>
    <p>In May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced that he and American industrialist and philanthropist Marvin Davis intended to develop "a network of independent stations as a fourth marketing force" to compete directly with CBS, NBC, and ABC through the purchase of six television stations owned by Metromedia.[33] In July 1985, 20th Century Fox announced Murdoch had completed his purchase of 50% of Fox Filmed Entertainment, the parent company of 20th Century Fox Film Corporation.[34] <br> 
       Subsequently, and prior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when News Corporation's BSkyB subsidiary began Europe's first 24-hour news channel (Sky News) in the United Kingdom in 1989.[35] With the success of his efforts establishing Fox as a TV network in the United States,[36][37] experience gained from Sky News and the turnaround of 20th Century Fox, Murdoch announced on January 30, 1996, that News Corp. would launch a 24-hour news channel on cable and satellite systems in the United States as part of a News Corp. "worldwide platform" for Fox programming: "The appetite for news – particularly news that explains to people how it affects them – is expanding enormously".[38]

       In February 1996, after former U.S. Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive[39] Roger Ailes left cable television channel America's Talking (now MSNBC), Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel. Ailes demanded five months of 14-hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows before its launch on October 7, 1996.[2] <br>
       At its debut 17 million households were able to watch FNC;[13] however, it was absent from the largest U.S. media markets of New York City and Los Angeles. Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as Fox on Crime or Fox on Politics, surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was The Schneider Report, with Mike Schneider's fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: The O'Reilly Report (later The O'Reilly Factor), The Crier Report (hosted by Catherine Crier) and Hannity & Colmes. From the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host (with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and "bullet points" when a host was delivering commentary). Fox News also created the "Fox News Alert", which interrupted its regular programming when a breaking news story occurred.[citation needed] <br>
       To accelerate its adoption by cable providers, Fox News paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel.[40] This contrasted with the normal practice, in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming. When Time Warner bought Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System, a federal antitrust consent decree required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own CNN on its cable systems. Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel, not Fox News. Fox News claimed this violated an agreement (to carry Fox News). Citing its agreement to keep its U.S. headquarters and a large studio in New York City, News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration to pressure Time Warner Cable (one of the city's two cable providers) to transmit Fox News on a city-owned channel.[41] City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner's cable franchises in the city.[42] <br>
       During the September 11, 2001, attacks, Fox News was the first news organization to run a news ticker on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day. The ticker has remained, informing viewers about additional news which reporters may not mention on-screen and repeating news mentioned during a broadcast; it has proven popular with viewers.[43] In January 2002, Fox News surpassed CNN in ratings for the first time.[44] <br>
       In 2023, The Economist reported that Murdoch had "ditched a plan" to remerge News Corporation with Fox because it "faced resistance from News Corp investors unhappy at the prospect of being lumped together with Fox News, which they consider a toxic brand."[45] <br>

    <h3>Political alignment</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Fox News has been described as practicing partisan reporting in favor of the Republican Party, the George W. Bush and Donald Trump administrations, and conservative causes,[22][23] while portraying the Democratic Party in a negative light.[25][26] Critics have argued that the channel is damaging to the integrity of news overall.[27][28] Fox News has denied bias in its news reporting and the channel's official position is that its news reporting operates independently of its opinion journalism.[29][needs update] Under oath following lawsuits regarding Fox News' coverage of the 2020 presidential election, Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch testified that Fox anchors endorsed conservative conspiracy theories about the election.[46] <br>
        In the 2004 documentary Outfoxed, four people identified as former employees said that Fox News made them "slant the news in favor of conservatives".[47] Fox News said that the film misrepresented the employment of these employees.[48]</p>
