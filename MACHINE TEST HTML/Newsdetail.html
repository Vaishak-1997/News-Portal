        <p id="p1">In an open letter, tech experts and leaders in the industry called for a six-month pause on AI experiments, a <br>
             move that Fox News contributor Douglas Murray believes shows a "deep concern" that is growing about the <br>
            risks of artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p id="p2">The letter, which was signed by Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, reads, in 
                   part: "AI systems <br> with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society 
                   … and should be planned for  and <br> managed with commensurate care. … Unfortunately, this
                   level of planning and management is not happening."</p>

        <p id="p3">Murray said on "Fox & Friends" Wednesday that the request for a moratorium is extraordinary and is a sign that <br>
                   experts are worried.</p>

        <h3 id="h3"><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/i-interviewed-chatgpt-as-if-human-heres-what-it-had-say-that-gave-me-chills" style="color:#036">I INTERVIEWED CHATGPT AS IF IT WAS A HUMAN; HERE'S WHAT IT HAD TO SAY THAT GAVE ME CHILLS</a></h3>

        <p id="p4">"The fact that there has now been this stressing that we could be in trouble. This is unprecedented," Murray told <br>
                    host Brian Kilmeade.</p>

        <p id="p5">He explained that concerns are stemming from the idea that the artificial intelligence technology is able to operate <br>
                   at a higher level than human intelligence. For example, Murray said ChatGPT is producing work that other technologies <br>
                   cannot detect as computer-generated.</p>

        <p id="p6">"So we are already in a state where the technology is running faster than teachers in America can run," he said.</p>
